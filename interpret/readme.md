The notebooks here do analysis on precocity and perplexity scores produced by other parts of the repo.

```FictionModelsJune.ipynb``` does analysis of fiction.

```LiteraryStudiesModelsJune.ipynb``` does analysis of literary studies, as you might expect.

```Econ_topicmodel_interpet_Github.ipynb``` analyzes precocity results for Econ calculated on topic distributions.

```Econ_tunedembed_interpret_Github.ipynb``` analyzes precocity results for Econ calculated on tuned embeddings.

There are also a number of older notebooks in the subfolder ```/oldnotebooks```, but they're not up to date and have only historical interest.
