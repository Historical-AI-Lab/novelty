semantic scholar
================

This repo contains code for getting citation metadata from Semantic Scholar and aligning it with our articles from JSTOR.

Lucian Li's original code is in ```semantic_scholar_metadata.ipynb```

An intermediate edit to work with JSTOR is ```align_jstor_w_semantic_scholar.ipynb```

The current best version of code to align and create metadata is ```Best_JSTOR-S2_Aligner.ipynb```. 

Condensed versions of the resulting metadata are the ../metadata folder.

We also have the full json results for these articles, listing all the citations to each article, but those files are big enough that we have not added them to the repo.
