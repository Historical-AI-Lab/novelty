semantic scholar
================

This repo contains code for getting citation metadata from Semantic Scholar and aligning it with our articles from JSTOR.

Lucian's original code is in ```semantic_scholar_metadata.ipynb```

Ted's edit to work with JSTOR is ```align_jstor_w_semantic_scholar.ipynb```

The resulting metadata is in ```LitStudiesMetaWithS2.tsv```

Ted also has the full json results for those articles, but they're big enough (49 MB) that we have not yet added them to the repo.
